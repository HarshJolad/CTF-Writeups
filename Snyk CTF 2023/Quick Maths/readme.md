# Quick Maths

## Challenge Description
> To try and get better grades in math, I made a program that gave me timed quizzes. Funny thing is that as I got better at the questions in this test, I got worse grades on my math tests.  

> NOTE: Float answers are rounded to 1 decimal points.  

> NOTE: And here's another twist... the answers to division questions depend on integer division or double division. I.e.,  
3/5 = 0    
3/5.0 = .6

## Solution
* On connecting to the instance, we are given some simple math questions
* We can write a script using `pwntools` to solve the question
* Using [script.py](./script.py), we can get the flag

### FLAG
